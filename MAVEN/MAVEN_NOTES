============
Phase-1
============

#1
	Java Build and Deployment End-To-End Workflow.

#2
Basics
	- Java program
	- manual compilation (javac filename)
	- manual Run (java class-name)

#3
What is Maven? Why we need a build tool?
	

#4
Installation
	- Download jdk and extract it to your favourite location.
	- Download Apache Maven and extract it to your favourite location.
	- Set-up below Environment variables for Maven and JDK in order to run Maven
	  and JDK commands from any directory in the system.
		1. JAVA_HOME
		2. M2_HOME
		3. PATH

Installing JDK and Maven:
=======================
  A. ENTERED values in this file $USER_HOME/.bashrc
  
  B. create below Environment variables
	export JAVA_HOME=/home/User/Directory/Directory/jdk1.8.0_191
	export M2_HOME=/home/User/Directory/Directory/apache-maven-3.6.0
	export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH



Load .bashrc using below command or open new ternimial
	$ source .bashrc
 
Verify Installation
	$ java -version
	$ mvn --version or mvn -v

#5
Maven's standard project layout
=================================
Project creation:
-----------------
java projects which are created by maven, ideally follows below project folder structure.
	
		flipkart
			|
			src		pom.xml
			|
	main--------- test
	|				|
   java		       java
	|				|
  (group .Id)	  (group.Id)
	|				|
App.java		AppTest.java


flipkart - is called "Project name" / "ArtifactID"
src 	 - Source folder which contains the 
				application source code
main	 - Contains application's main functional code
test	 - Contains application's unit testing code
pom.xml  - Maven's build file using which we can
				configure build steps such as 
				compilation, test runs, jar/war creation,
				deployments...etc.


#6
Creating a Java Project using Maven: (It is for standlone project)

$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.Flipkart -DartifactId=Flipkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false
(Note :- For creating Maven project we need GAV parameter).
